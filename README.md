# HeatMapWithD3

This is a Free Code Camp challenge.It shows the global Land-Surface temprature changes since 1753.

The scale in the bottom corner is the difference between the temprature and the Jan 1951-Dec 1980 average, 
which is estimated â„ƒ: 8.66 +/- 0.07.

But the hint shows the average temprature of some month, not the variance.
